## 2025-07-24: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Tech Lead, Team

### Decision

PinSquirrel will be developed as a personal bookmark management tool that supports multiple content formats (links, images, markdown, articles), built primarily to solve the creator's own content organization frustrations. Privacy measures will be implemented to minimize operational complexity and regulatory compliance burden, providing reasonable privacy benefits as a secondary advantage.

### Context

This is fundamentally a "scratch my own itch" product addressing personal frustrations with existing bookmark management solutions. Current tools are either too basic (browser bookmarks) or bloated with unnecessary features. By building a focused solution for actual use cases, we can create something genuinely useful. Privacy measures are implemented primarily to reduce GDPR/CCPA compliance overhead rather than as a core market differentiator.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Privacy-First Marketing Approach**

   - Pros: Clear market positioning, growing privacy awareness
   - Cons: Not authentic to actual motivations, creates unrealistic user expectations

2. **Note-Taking App with Bookmarking**

   - Pros: Broader appeal, more use cases, potential for higher engagement
   - Cons: Diluted focus, complex feature set, competes with established players

3. **Read-Later Service Clone**
   - Pros: Proven market demand, clear user expectations
   - Cons: Direct competition with Pocket/Instapaper, limited differentiation

### Rationale

The personal-needs-first approach was chosen because:

- Authentic motivation ensures sustained development effort
- Building for real use cases creates genuinely useful features
- Privacy-as-operational-simplicity reduces development burden
- Can still appeal to secondary users with similar needs
- Avoids over-engineering for theoretical requirements

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Features prioritized by genuine utility rather than market research
- Sustainable development motivation
- Reduced compliance complexity through minimal data collection
- Honest positioning builds authentic user relationships

**Negative:**

- Smaller potential market than privacy-focused positioning
- May miss some privacy-conscious users seeking extreme measures
- Less "marketable" story than privacy-first narrative

## 2025-07-24: Technology Stack Selection

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Tech Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Adopt a monorepo architecture using pnpm workspaces with React Router 7 (Framework mode) for the web application, PostgreSQL for data persistence, and clean architecture principles with dependency injection for maintainability.

### Context

The project needs a modern, maintainable architecture that supports rapid development while ensuring code quality. The choice of technologies should balance developer productivity with long-term maintainability and performance.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Next.js with Prisma**

   - Pros: Popular stack, extensive ecosystem, good DX
   - Cons: Heavier framework, less control over SSR behavior

2. **Remix (older version) with TypeORM**

   - Pros: Similar to React Router 7, mature ORM
   - Cons: Remix is now React Router 7, TypeORM is heavier

3. **Vite SPA with Express API**
   - Pros: Maximum flexibility, lightweight
   - Cons: More boilerplate, need to handle SSR manually

### Rationale

React Router 7 with Drizzle was chosen because:

- React Router 7 provides modern SSR with excellent DX
- Drizzle offers type-safe queries with minimal overhead
- Monorepo structure enables clean separation of concerns
- Clean architecture ensures testability and maintainability
- TypeScript throughout provides type safety

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Type-safe from database to UI
- Excellent developer experience with hot reloading
- Clean separation enables independent testing
- Future-proof with React 19 and modern tooling

**Negative:**

- React Router 7 is relatively new (but stable)
- Monorepo adds initial complexity
- Team needs to understand clean architecture principles

## 2025-07-24: Practical Privacy Architecture

**ID:** DEC-003
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner, Security Lead, Development Team

### Decision

Implement zero PII storage by hashing email addresses before database storage, using only essential cookies for authentication, and avoiding user tracking primarily to reduce operational complexity and regulatory compliance burden.

### Context

Privacy measures are implemented to minimize GDPR/CCPA compliance requirements and reduce operational overhead rather than as a core product differentiator. By storing no personally identifiable information (PII), we avoid regulatory complexity while providing reasonable privacy benefits to users. This approach prioritizes operational simplicity over extreme privacy measures.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Standard Email + Password Storage**

   - Pros: Familiar patterns, easier account recovery, standard features
   - Cons: GDPR/CCPA compliance overhead, potential liability from data breaches

2. **Extreme Privacy Measures (Client-side encryption, zero-knowledge)**

   - Pros: Maximum privacy protection, strong market differentiation
   - Cons: Complex implementation, performance overhead, limits functionality

3. **Anonymous Accounts Only**

   - Pros: Zero compliance burden, maximum simplicity
   - Cons: No account recovery, higher user friction

### Rationale

Email hashing was chosen because:

- Provides account recovery without storing PII
- One-way hash prevents email extraction
- Familiar login flow for users
- Can still send emails by having users re-enter for specific actions
- Complies with privacy regulations by default

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- PII privacy protection even in breach scenarios
- Simplified GDPR/CCPA compliance
- Strong market differentiation
- Reduced liability from data storage

**Negative:**

- Cannot send unsolicited emails (feature, not bug)
- Password reset requires email re-entry
- Cannot implement email-based features easily
- May lose some users who forget their exact email
