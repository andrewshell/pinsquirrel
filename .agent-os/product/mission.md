## Pitch

PinSquirrel is a personal bookmark management tool that helps users organize and consume web content through multiple formats, built first and foremost to solve the creator's own content organization needs.

## Users

### Primary Customer

- **The Creator**: This is fundamentally a "scratch my own itch" product designed to solve personal content management frustrations

### Secondary Customers

- **Content Curators**: People who actively collect and organize web content for personal or professional use
- **Content Consumers**: Individuals who save articles, resources, and references for later consumption

### User Personas

**Personal Content Manager** (25-45 years old)

- **Role:** Knowledge Worker/Developer
- **Context:** Manages hundreds of bookmarks across devices, frustrated with existing solutions
- **Pain Points:** Browser bookmarks are disorganized and not portable, existing services are either too simple or overcomplicated
- **Goals:** Maintain a clean, searchable content library that actually works

**Content Researcher** (30-55 years old)

- **Role:** Researcher/Writer/Academic
- **Context:** Regularly saves articles, images, and references for projects
- **Pain Points:** Difficult to organize different content types in one place, need offline access to saved content
- **Goals:** Build a personal knowledge base, access saved content in multiple formats

## The Problem

### Fragmented Content Management

Most users save content across multiple platforms (browser bookmarks, read-later apps, note-taking tools) leading to a fragmented and hard-to-search personal library. This fragmentation reduces productivity and makes it difficult to rediscover valuable content.

**Our Solution:** Unified content management supporting links, images, articles, and markdown in one searchable interface.

### Inadequate Existing Solutions

Current bookmark services are either too basic (browser bookmarks) or bloated with features that get in the way. Many require complicated workflows or don't support the content formats users actually need.

**Our Solution:** Simple, focused tool that handles multiple content types without unnecessary complexity.

### Limited Content Formats

Traditional bookmarking tools only save URLs, missing rich content like images, full articles, or formatted notes. Users lose context and content when sites go offline.

**Our Solution:** Multi-format support including images, markdown copies, and read-later article storage.

## Differentiators

### Practical Privacy by Design

We minimize data collection primarily to reduce operational complexity and regulatory compliance burden. No PII storage means fewer legal headaches for the developer and happens to benefit privacy-conscious users. We're not implementing extreme privacy measures, but we're not collecting data we don't need either.

### Multi-Format Content Storage

Unlike traditional bookmarking tools, we support saving content as links, images, full articles, and markdown documents. This results in a comprehensive personal library that preserves content even when original sources disappear.

### Built for Real Use Cases

This tool is built to solve actual daily frustrations rather than theoretical user needs. Features are prioritized based on genuine utility rather than market research or feature checklists.

## Key Features

### Core Features

- **Pin Management:** Create, organize, and search bookmarks with custom tags and descriptions
- **Multi-Format Support:** Save content as links, images, markdown documents, or read-later articles
- **Tag System:** Flexible tagging system for organizing content across multiple categories
- **Minimal Data Collection:** No PII storage to reduce compliance overhead while providing basic privacy benefits
- **Search Functionality:** Full-text search across titles, descriptions, and tags

### Future Features

- **Import/Export:** Easily import bookmarks from browsers or export for backup
- **RSS Aggregation:** Automatically populate pins from RSS feeds
- **API Access:** Programmatic access for integrations and automation

## Privacy Approach

Privacy measures are implemented primarily for operational simplicity:

- **No PII Storage:** Reduces GDPR/CCPA compliance requirements
- **Hashed Authentication:** Minimal user identification needed
- **Data Minimization:** Only collect what's necessary for functionality

This approach provides reasonable privacy protection without extreme measures like client-side encryption or zero-knowledge architecture. Users who need maximum privacy should consider self-hosting or more specialized privacy tools.
