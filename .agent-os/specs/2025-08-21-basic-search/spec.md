## Overview

Implement a basic search functionality that allows users to quickly find pins by searching through URLs, titles and descriptions. The search interface will be accessible via a search icon in the header next to the profile menu.

## User Stories

### Quick Pin Discovery

As a Personal Content Manager, I want to search for pins by typing keywords, so that I can quickly find the content I saved without browsing through all my pins.

When I click the search icon in the header, a search input appears where I can type keywords. As I type, the system searches through pin URLs, titles and descriptions, displaying matching results on the current page. This helps me rediscover bookmarks I saved weeks or months ago when I only remember a few keywords about them.

### Efficient Content Retrieval

As a Content Researcher, I want to search my pins while maintaining my current context, so that I can find related resources without losing my place in the application.

The search functionality is always accessible from the header, allowing me to perform searches from any page. The search results replace the current view, but I can easily return to my previous context. This workflow supports my research process where I frequently need to cross-reference saved materials.

## Spec Scope

1. **Search Icon in Header** - Add a search icon button next to the profile menu that triggers the search interface
2. **Search Input Interface** - Expandable search bar that appears when the search icon is clicked
3. **Basic Text Search** - Search functionality that queries pin URLs, titles and descriptions using partial text matching
4. **Search Results Display** - Show matching pins in the standard pin list view with preserved formatting
5. **Search State Management** - Maintain search query in URL parameters for shareable and bookmarkable searches

## Out of Scope

- Full-text search across markdown content
- Search suggestions or autocomplete
- Advanced search filters (tags, dates, etc.)
- Search result highlighting
- Search history or saved searches

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can click a search icon in the header to reveal a search input field
2. Typing in the search field and pressing Enter or clicking search executes a query against pin URLs, titles and descriptions
3. Search results are displayed in the familiar pin list format with pagination support
