> Spec: Pin Deletion with Confirmation
> Created: 2025-08-09
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a safe pin deletion workflow with user confirmation to prevent accidental data loss. This feature will allow users to permanently remove pins from their collection while providing appropriate safeguards and feedback.

## User Stories

### Safe Pin Deletion

As a content manager, I want to delete pins I no longer need with a confirmation step, so that I can clean up my collection without accidentally losing important bookmarks.

When a user clicks a delete button on a pin, they should see a confirmation dialog that clearly explains the action is permanent. The dialog should show the pin title and allow the user to confirm or cancel the deletion. After successful deletion, the user should receive feedback that the operation completed.

### Batch Deletion Prevention

As a user managing hundreds of pins, I want individual deletion to require explicit confirmation, so that I don't accidentally delete multiple items when trying to clean up my collection.

Each pin deletion should be a deliberate action requiring confirmation, preventing accidental mass deletion while keeping the interface clean and uncluttered.

## Spec Scope

1. **Delete Button UI** - Add delete button to pin cards and pin detail views
2. **Confirmation Dialog** - Modal dialog with pin details and confirm/cancel options  
3. **Deletion Action** - React Router action to handle pin deletion server-side
4. **Success Feedback** - User notification when deletion completes successfully
5. **Error Handling** - Appropriate error messages for failed deletions

## Out of Scope

- Bulk/batch deletion of multiple pins
- "Soft delete" or trash/recycle bin functionality
- Undo deletion capability
- Deletion history or audit logging

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can delete individual pins through a confirmation workflow in the browser
2. Accidental deletions are prevented through explicit confirmation dialogs
3. Appropriate success and error feedback is provided throughout the process
