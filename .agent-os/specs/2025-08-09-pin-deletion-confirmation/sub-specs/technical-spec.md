# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-09-pin-deletion-confirmation/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-09
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Delete button integrated into existing PinCard component
- Confirmation dialog using shadcn/ui Dialog component with proper accessibility
- React Router 7 action to handle deletion server-side with proper validation
- Optimistic UI updates with rollback on failure
- Toast notifications for success/error feedback using existing notification system
- Proper loading states during deletion process

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Modal Dialog with Form Submission
- Pros: Follows React Router 7 patterns, accessible, proper form handling
- Cons: Slightly more complex implementation

**Option B:** JavaScript confirm() Dialog (Selected)
- Pros: Simple implementation, native browser behavior, no additional UI components
- Cons: Less customizable, not consistent with app design system

**Option C:** Inline Confirmation UI
- Pros: No modal overlay, stays in context
- Cons: Complex state management, doesn't prevent accidental clicks as effectively

**Rationale:** Option A was selected because it provides the best user experience with proper accessibility support, follows React Router 7 patterns for form handling, and integrates well with the existing shadcn/ui design system.

## Implementation Details

### UI Components

**PinCard Enhancement:**
- Add delete button with trash icon to pin card actions
- Button should be visually distinct (destructive styling)
- Include appropriate aria-label for accessibility

**Confirmation Dialog:**
- Use shadcn/ui Dialog component
- Display pin title and URL in dialog
- Clear "Delete Pin" and "Cancel" buttons
- Focus management for accessibility

**Toast Notifications:**
- Success: "Pin deleted successfully"
- Error: "Failed to delete pin. Please try again."

### React Router 7 Integration

**Route Action:**
```typescript
// In pins route file
export async function action({ request, params }: ActionFunctionArgs) {
  if (request.method === "DELETE") {
    const pinId = params.pinId
    // Validation and deletion logic
    return redirect("/pins")
  }
}
```

**Form Integration:**
- Use React Router Form component for deletion
- Method="DELETE" with hidden pinId input
- Proper CSRF protection if implemented

### Database Operations

**Pin Deletion:**
- Verify pin ownership before deletion
- Handle foreign key constraints (pin_tags relationships)
- Use database transaction for consistency
- Return appropriate error codes for different failure scenarios

## External Dependencies

No new external dependencies are required. The implementation uses:

- **shadcn/ui Dialog** - Already available in the project
- **React Router 7 Forms** - Core framework functionality  
- **Lucide React Icons** - Already available for trash icon
- **Existing notification system** - For success/error feedback
