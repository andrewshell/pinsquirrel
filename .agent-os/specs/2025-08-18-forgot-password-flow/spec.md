# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Forgot Password Flow
> Created: 2025-08-18
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a secure password reset functionality that allows users to regain account access through email verification using Mailgun. This feature will reduce support overhead and improve user experience by providing self-service account recovery while maintaining the existing privacy-focused architecture.

## User Stories

### Password Reset Request

As a user who has forgotten their password, I want to request a password reset by entering my email address, so that I can regain access to my account without contacting support.

The user enters their email address on a forgot password form, the system generates a secure token, sends a reset email via Mailgun, and provides confirmation that the email has been sent (without revealing whether the email exists in the system).

### Password Reset Completion

As a user with a password reset token, I want to set a new password using the secure link from my email, so that I can access my account with the new credentials.

The user clicks the reset link from their email, is presented with a secure form to enter a new password, and upon successful submission, can immediately log in with their new password.

## Spec Scope

1. **Password Reset Token Management** - Generate, store, and validate secure tokens with expiration
2. **Email Service Integration** - Integrate Mailgun for sending password reset emails
3. **Database Schema Extension** - Add password reset tokens table with proper relationships
4. **Clean Architecture Implementation** - Create interfaces in core and implementations in separate packages
5. **Web Routes and UI** - Forgot password form and reset password form with validation

## Out of Scope

- Multi-factor authentication during password reset
- Account lockout mechanisms
- Password history enforcement
- Email template customization beyond basic branding

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can request password reset by entering email address at /forgot-password
2. Password reset emails are sent via Mailgun with secure tokens
3. Users can set new password using token at /reset-password/:token
