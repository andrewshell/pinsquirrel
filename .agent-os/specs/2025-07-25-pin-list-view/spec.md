# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Pin List View
> Created: 2025-07-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a paginated list view that displays all pins for the authenticated user, providing the foundational UI for pin management. This view will serve as the main interface where users can see and interact with their saved bookmarks.

## User Stories

### View All Pins

As a Personal Content Manager, I want to view all my saved pins in a clean, organized list, so that I can quickly browse through my bookmark collection.

Users will access their pin list immediately after logging in or by navigating to the main pins page. The list should display essential information for each pin (title, URL, description preview, tags) in a scannable format. Pagination controls will allow users to navigate through large collections without overwhelming the interface.

### Navigate Large Collections

As a Content Researcher, I want to navigate through hundreds of pins using pagination, so that the interface remains responsive and manageable.

When users have accumulated many pins over time, they need efficient navigation through pages of results. The pagination should clearly indicate the current page, total pages, and provide intuitive controls to move between pages. Page size should be reasonable (20-30 items) to balance information density with performance.

## Spec Scope

1. **Pin List Component** - Display pins in a clean, scannable list format with title, URL, description preview, and tags
2. **Pagination Controls** - Navigate through pages of pins with clear page indicators and navigation buttons
3. **Empty State** - Show helpful message and call-to-action when user has no pins
4. **Loading States** - Display appropriate loading indicators during data fetching
5. **Basic Pin Actions** - Provide action buttons for edit/delete operations (functionality in later specs)

## Out of Scope

- Pin creation functionality (separate spec)
- Pin editing functionality (separate spec)
- Search and filtering capabilities (Phase 1, but separate spec)
- Bulk operations on multiple pins
- Tag management interface

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can view their pins in a paginated list after logging in
2. Pagination controls allow navigation through multiple pages of pins
3. Each pin displays title, URL, description preview, and associated tags in a clean layout
