# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Tag Management UI
> Created: 2025-08-17
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement user interface components for managing tags on pins, enabling users to add and remove tags during pin creation and editing through an intuitive and accessible interface.

## User Stories

### Tag Input During Pin Creation

As a content curator, I want to add tags when creating a new pin, so that I can immediately organize my content into categories for later discovery.

**Workflow:** User enters URL and title, then adds relevant tags using a tag input field with autocomplete suggestions from their existing tags. Tags are validated and associated with the pin upon creation.

### Tag Management on Existing Pins

As a personal content manager, I want to edit tags on existing pins, so that I can improve my content organization as my needs evolve.

**Workflow:** User edits an existing pin and sees current tags displayed as removable chips. They can remove unwanted tags and add new ones using the same autocomplete interface from pin creation.

### Tag Autocomplete and Validation

As a knowledge worker, I want suggested tags based on my existing ones, so that I maintain consistent tagging without memorizing all my tag names.

**Workflow:** User starts typing in tag input and sees dropdown suggestions matching their existing tags. Invalid tag names (containing special characters) show validation errors with clear guidance.

## Spec Scope

1. **Tag Input Component** - Reusable component with text input, tag chips, and autocomplete functionality
2. **Form Integration** - Add tag input to pin creation and edit forms with proper validation
3. **API Integration** - Fetch user's existing tags for autocomplete suggestions
4. **Tag Validation** - Client-side validation using existing tag name schema rules
5. **Accessibility** - Proper ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support

## Out of Scope

- Tag deletion/management beyond pin associations
- Tag renaming functionality  
- Tag usage analytics or statistics
- Bulk tag operations across multiple pins
- Tag hierarchies or nested tags

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional tag input on pin creation form** - Users can add tags when creating new pins
2. **Tag editing on existing pins** - Users can modify tags when editing pins through the edit form
3. **Autocomplete functionality** - Tag input suggests existing user tags as user types
