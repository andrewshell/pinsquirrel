# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Pin Creation Form
> Created: 2025-08-05
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement a user interface form that allows authenticated users to create new pins by entering a URL, title, and description. This feature will provide the primary way for users to add bookmarks to their PinSquirrel collection, supporting the core value proposition of unified content management.

## User Stories

### Primary Pin Creation Story

As a content curator, I want to quickly save a webpage with title and description, so that I can build my personal knowledge library without losing track of valuable content.

The user navigates to a pin creation form, enters the URL of content they want to save, adds a descriptive title and optional notes about why this content is valuable, then submits the form to create a new pin that appears in their collection.

### Assisted Pin Creation Story

As a busy knowledge worker, I want the form to automatically fetch page titles when I enter a URL, so that I can quickly save content without manually typing repetitive information.

When the user enters a valid URL and moves focus away from the URL field, the application attempts to fetch the page title and populate the title field automatically, while still allowing manual override.

## Spec Scope

1. **Pin Creation Form UI** - A form with URL, title, and description fields using shadcn/ui components
2. **Form Validation** - Client-side validation for required fields and URL format
3. **Automatic Title Fetching** - Fetch page title from URL when possible to reduce user effort
4. **Form Submission** - Submit new pin data to backend API and handle success/error states
5. **Navigation Integration** - Proper routing integration with React Router 7

## Out of Scope

- Tag management (handled in separate Phase 1 feature)
- Multi-format content support (Phase 2 feature)
- Bulk pin creation
- Import from external sources
- Pin editing (separate Phase 1 feature)

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can navigate to `/pins/new` and see a clean pin creation form
2. Form validates URL format and required fields before submission
3. Successfully submitted pins are saved to the database and user is redirected to pin list
