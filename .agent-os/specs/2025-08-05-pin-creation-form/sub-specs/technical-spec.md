# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-05-pin-creation-form/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-05
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

- Form component built with React using shadcn/ui components (Input, Textarea, Button)
- Client-side form validation using React Hook Form with zod schema validation
- URL validation to ensure proper format (http/https required)
- Automatic title fetching using a server-side API endpoint that fetches page metadata
- Form submission with loading states and error handling
- Success state with navigation back to pin list view
- Responsive design following existing app patterns
- Integration with existing authentication system to associate pins with current user

## Approach Options

**Option A:** Single-page form with inline validation and auto-save
- Pros: Modern UX, prevents data loss, immediate validation feedback
- Cons: More complex state management, potential for API spam on auto-save

**Option B:** Traditional form with submit button and validation on submit (Selected)
- Pros: Simple implementation, clear user intent, easy to test, follows familiar patterns
- Cons: User might lose data on accidental navigation, less modern feel

**Option C:** Multi-step wizard form
- Pros: Could accommodate future multi-format features, guided experience
- Cons: Over-engineered for simple URL/title/description, adds unnecessary complexity

**Rationale:** Option B selected because it's appropriate for the current simple requirements, easier to implement and test, and aligns with the product philosophy of avoiding over-engineering. The form is simple enough that a traditional submit pattern provides the best user experience without unnecessary complexity.

## External Dependencies

- **@hookform/resolvers** - React Hook Form integration with zod validation
  - Justification: Provides type-safe form validation with excellent developer experience
- **zod** - TypeScript-first schema validation library
  - Justification: Already used in the project, provides runtime validation that matches TypeScript types

## Implementation Details

### Form Fields
- **URL**: Required text input with URL validation
- **Title**: Required text input, auto-populated from URL metadata when available
- **Description**: Optional textarea for user notes

### Auto-Title Fetching
- Debounced API call triggered when URL field loses focus and contains valid URL
- Server endpoint fetches HTML and extracts `<title>` tag
- Graceful fallback if title extraction fails
- User can override auto-populated title

### Error Handling
- Display field-level validation errors inline
- Show global error message for API failures
- Maintain form state during error conditions
- Provide retry mechanism for failed submissions
