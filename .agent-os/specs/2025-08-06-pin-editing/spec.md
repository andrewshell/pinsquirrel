## Overview

Implement pin editing functionality that allows users to modify existing pins through a dedicated edit interface. This feature will enable users to update pin URLs, titles, descriptions, and maintain existing tag associations through a user-friendly form interface.

## User Stories

### Edit Pin Details

As a personal content manager, I want to edit my existing pins' URL, title, and description, so that I can keep my bookmarks accurate and up-to-date when content changes or I discover better descriptions.

When I click an "Edit" button on a pin, I should be taken to an edit form pre-populated with the current pin data. After making changes and submitting, I should see the updated pin in my list with a success confirmation.

### Preserve Tag Associations

As a content curator, I want my existing tags to be preserved when editing pins, so that I don't lose my organizational structure when making simple updates to pin details.

The edit form should show current tags associated with the pin and maintain those associations unless I explicitly change them. The edit process should not accidentally remove or modify tags.

### Error Handling and Validation

As a user, I want clear feedback when my pin edit fails due to validation errors or network issues, so that I can understand what went wrong and how to fix it.

If I enter invalid data (like a malformed URL), I should see specific error messages. If the server is unreachable, I should see a clear error message and be able to retry.

## Spec Scope

1. **Pin Edit Route** - Create `/pins/:id/edit` route with form pre-populated with existing pin data
2. **Edit Form Component** - Reusable form component for editing pin URL, title, and description
3. **Server Action** - Update existing updatePin API endpoint to handle form submissions
4. **Validation** - Client and server-side validation using existing pin schemas
5. **Tag Preservation** - Maintain existing tag associations during edit operations

## Out of Scope

- Tag editing within pin edit form (will be handled separately)
- Bulk pin editing
- Pin deletion functionality
- Content or image path editing
- Advanced pin metadata editing

## Expected Deliverable

1. Users can navigate to `/pins/:id/edit` and see a form pre-populated with pin data
2. Users can modify URL, title, and description fields with proper validation
3. Form submission successfully updates the pin and redirects to pins list with success message
