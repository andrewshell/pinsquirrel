# Tests Specification

This is the tests coverage details for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-06-pin-editing/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-06
> Version: 1.0.0

## Test Coverage

### Unit Tests

**PinCreationForm (Edit Mode)**
- Renders with pre-populated data when in edit mode
- Changes submit button text to "Update Pin" in edit mode
- Validates form data using existing validation schemas
- Handles form submission with edit-specific data structure
- Preserves accessibility features in edit mode
- Shows appropriate loading states during update

**Route Loader (/pins/:id/edit)**
- Fetches pin data for authenticated user
- Returns 404 for non-existent pins
- Returns 404 for pins not owned by current user
- Handles database errors gracefully

**Route Action (/pins/:id/edit)**
- Updates pin successfully with valid data
- Validates form data using existing schemas
- Returns validation errors for invalid input
- Handles duplicate URL conflicts
- Sets success flash message on successful update
- Redirects to pins list after successful update

### Integration Tests

**Pin Edit Workflow**
- User can navigate to edit page from pin list/card
- Form loads with current pin data pre-populated
- User can modify fields and submit successfully
- Updated pin appears in pins list with changes
- Error handling displays appropriate messages to user

**Authentication and Authorization**
- Unauthenticated users redirected to login
- Users cannot edit pins they don't own
- Session expiry handled gracefully during edit

**Data Validation and Persistence**
- URL validation prevents invalid URLs
- Title validation enforces length requirements
- Description validation handles optional field correctly
- Database updates reflect form changes accurately
- Tag associations preserved during pin updates

### Component Tests

**PinCreationForm Edit Mode**
- Pre-populates fields with provided initial data
- Submits correct data structure for updates
- Displays edit-appropriate button text and messaging
- Handles loading and error states appropriately
- Maintains keyboard navigation and screen reader support

**Route Integration**
- Edit route serves correct page with form
- Form submission processes through correct action
- Redirects and flash messages work correctly
- Error boundaries catch and display errors appropriately

### Mocking Requirements

**PinService Methods:**
- Mock `getPin()` to return test pin data for form pre-population
- Mock `updatePin()` to simulate successful updates and various error conditions
- Mock authentication service to test authorized/unauthorized scenarios

**Form Submission:**
- Mock React Router's form submission to test component behavior
- Mock network requests to test loading and error states

**Database Operations:**
- Mock database queries to test edge cases (pin not found, duplicate URLs)
- Mock validation errors to test error handling and display

## End-to-End Test Scenarios

**Happy Path:**
1. User logs in and navigates to pins list
2. User clicks edit button on existing pin
3. Edit form loads with current pin data
4. User modifies URL, title, or description
5. User submits form
6. Pin is updated and user redirected to pins list
7. Success message displayed and updated pin visible

**Error Handling:**
1. User attempts to edit non-existent pin → 404 error
2. User submits invalid URL → validation error displayed
3. User submits URL that already exists → conflict error displayed
4. Network error during submission → error message with retry option
