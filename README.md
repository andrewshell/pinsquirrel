## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22 or higher
- Corepack (included with Node.js 16+)

### Setup

1. Enable corepack to use the exact pnpm version specified in package.json:

```bash
corepack enable
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```bash
DB_FILE_NAME=file:local.db
INVITE_CODE=your-secret-invite-code
```

### Installation

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

> **Note**: The project uses the pnpm version specified in the `packageManager` field of package.json. Corepack will automatically use the correct version.

### Database Setup

Run database migrations to set up the schema:

```bash
pnpm drizzle-kit migrate
```

To reset the database (remove all data and recreate):

```bash
rm local.db
pnpm drizzle-kit migrate
```

### Development

Start the development server with HMR:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Your application will be available at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Testing

Run the test suite:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Run tests with coverage:

```bash
pnpm test:coverage
```

## Code Quality

Check and fix code issues with ESLint:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm lint:fix
```

Format code with Prettier:

```bash
pnpm format
pnpm format:check
```

## Building for Production

Create a production build:

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Database Management

### Available Drizzle Commands

- **Run migrations**: `pnpm drizzle-kit migrate`
- **Generate new migration**: `pnpm drizzle-kit generate`
- **Push schema changes**: `pnpm drizzle-kit push`
- **Reset database**: Remove `local.db` and run `pnpm drizzle-kit migrate`

### Database Schema

The application uses SQLite with the following tables:

- **users**: Stores user accounts with hashed emails and passwords

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

To build and run using Docker:

```bash
docker build -t my-app .

# Run the container
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

The containerized application can be deployed to any platform that supports Docker, including:

- AWS ECS
- Google Cloud Run
- Azure Container Apps
- Digital Ocean App Platform
- Fly.io
- Railway

### DIY Deployment

If you're familiar with deploying Node applications, the built-in app server is production-ready.

Make sure to deploy the output of `pnpm build`

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ package-lock.json (or pnpm-lock.yaml, or bun.lockb)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ build/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client/    # Static assets
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ server/    # Server-side code
```

## Styling

This template comes with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) already configured for a simple default starting experience. You can use whatever CSS framework you prefer.
